# Soft-Arch

Software environnement allowing easy source code analysis across projects. Write source code analysers in any language and use its outputs to display information or as inputs to other analysers.

### Prerequisites

You need `npm` installed on your computer prior to run and build the project.

Install all the dependencies the first time you want to run the project :
```
npm install
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See the "Building" chapter for notes on how to build a release version of the project.

Run the code with the following command :
```
npm start
```

The project will restart on each code modification.

## Running the tests

```
npm run test
```

## Building release version

Not yet.

## Built With

* [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A typed superset of JavaScript
* [lodash](https://lodash.com/) - A JavaScript utility library
* [node-json-socket](https://github.com/sebastianseilund/node-json-socket) - Send JSON over sockets

## Contributing

Feel free to do whatever you want, the project is not really mature at this stage.

## Versioning

I plan to use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning when all the base features will be implemented and the project will gain momentum.
